## Hello everybody ðŸ‘‹

My name is Facundo Sichi and I am an advanced student in Information Systems Engineering. Full-time programmer, fond of technology and the constant improvement of computer techniques or processes.

I have knowledge in many technological tools and programming languages, in which I am in a constant process of learning and improvement.

The skills and qualities that stand out the most in my professional profile are adaptation to the environment, perseverance, commitment, perseverance, passion, charisma, resilience, creativity and, above all, leadership skills. I consider that my methodologies are effective when it comes to organization and management of work teams, not only in the structuring of tasks, but also in giving encouragement and motivation to those who need it, pushing the capacities of my colleagues to their maximum.

Since I was little I have pursued the same dream which consists of being able to change the world and leave a mark with my skills and knowledge, to be a pioneer in the creation of algorithms that facilitate the way we currently perceive things with the aim of always seeking perfection. and continuous improvement.
